## Usage/Setup

1. Make sure to have the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.7.0+ is compatible

2. Download the [Management_Panel source code](https://github.com/HyperNylium/Management_Panel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from Github

3. Un-Zip the `Management_Panel-main.zip` file in your desktop (Read Notes to find why)

4. And launch the `Updater.exe` file in [administrator](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/run-as-admin-windows-11/#ftoc-heading-5) mode in order for everything to install correctly

## Notes to keep in mind
- The program will automatically detect your home directorys desktop location. For example:<br>`C:\Users\[user]\Desktop)`

- The program will only work if its on your desktop directory(the whole folder). But you can change this behavior by opening `Management_Panel.py` in your preferred text editor then change the<br>`GetUserDesktopLocation = winshell.desktop()`<br> variable to:<br>`GetUserDesktopLocation = "[your preferred directory]"`<br>For example: `GetUserDesktopLocation = "C:\Users\[user]\Downloads)"`

- You can change whatever you want but this is the most stable i have been able to make it.<br>But, if you do make a more better looking/stable version please send me a link to your work [Here](http://www.hypernylium.com/en-en/customer-support/) ;)
