## Usage/Setup

1. Download the [source code](https://github.com/HyperNylium/Management_Panel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from Github

2. Un-Zip the `Management_Panel-main.zip` file in your desktop (Read Notes to find why)

3. And launch the `Updater.exe` file. When opening this app you'll have to run this app as an [administrator](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/run-as-admin-windows-11/#ftoc-heading-5) in order to install the python libraries on your [PATH](https://www.maketecheasier.com/what-is-the-windows-path/) correctly

## Notes to keep in mind
- The program will automatically detect your home directory (for example, C:\Users\[user]\Desktop)

- The program will only work if its on your desktop directory(the whole folder). But you can change this behavior by opening `Management_Panel.py` in preferred text editor then changing the<br>`GetUserDesktopLocation = winshell.desktop()` to `GetUserDesktopLocation = "[your preferred directory]"`<br>For example: `GetUserDesktopLocation = "C:\Users\david\Desktop"`

- You can change whatever you want but this is the most stable i have been able to make it.<br>But, if you do make a more better looking/stable version please send me a link to your work [Here](http://www.hypernylium.com/en-en/customer-support/) ;)
