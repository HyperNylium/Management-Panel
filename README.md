## New with this update

- Made the navagation bar able to collapse and expand.

- Instead of the navagation bar title being "Management panel" now it displays the current date and time. The format changes accoreding to the navagation bar state to better fit the UI and elements.

- Added a "responsive mode" toggle in the `Settings` tab. When toggled, the app will be resizable.

- Added a new event scheduling system. Instead of using the normal `.after_cancel` method like this:\
`[widget].after_cancel([after id])`\
I created the `schedule_cancel` function like this:\
`schedule_cancel([widget], [function name])`\
`schedule_cancel(navigation_frame_label, UpdateTitleInfo)`\
This method only needs the function name to cancel the after event. And to schedule a new event I made a `schedule_create` function like this:\
`schedule_create([widget], [function name], [after time], [if any, args])`\
`schedule_create(navigation_frame_label, 1000, UpdateTitleInfo)`\
This will create an after event that will run the function `UpdateTitleInfo` every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and save the after event id as the value and the function name as the key in a dictionary like this:\
`{'UpdateTitleInfo': 'after#6'} | {'function name': 'after event id'}`


- Before, the app was only working with customtkinter version `4.1.2`. But now it works with version `5.1.2` and above.

- starting to make the app responsive (not fully responsive yet but it's a start).

- Implemented settings file called `settings.json`. When the app first launches, it creates the settings file using the default settings in the current working directory. Then, once created, it gets all settings by reading that file. You can open the file by going to\
`Settings > Open settings.json` in the app.
```json
// Default values for settings.json

```

- UI update.

- Integrated YouTube downloader.

- Integrated ChatGPT/OpenAI (you can change all of its settings in the `settings.json` file).

- New devices tab. When you have a Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, or headset, simply go to the `settings.json` file and from the device manager in Windows under Bluetooth, find your device's name and put it in the `Devices` section like this:

```json
"Devices": [
  "YOUR DEVICE NAME",
  "BSK V3 PRO" // putting my own mouse name as an example.
] 
```

- After response is Received from ChatGPT/openai, if you have the **Speak response from AI** toggled, it will start to speak the responce to you

- You can directly change your power mode from the **System** tab. The dropdown will show you all available power modes, and the title of the dropdown will show you the active one (the mode that shows even when you didn't click the dropdown).

- Even if you are either downloading a file from YouTube or waiting for a response from ChatGPT, you can still switch through different tabs in the app. I wouldn't suggest this, but you can even change some settings from **settings.json**, and the thing would occasionally run (As I said, not recommended, but possible).

## Tested devices for "Devices" tab

|         Device          | Battery Data |
|:-----------------------:|:------------:|
| Razor Basilisk V3 Pro   |     Yes      |
| Airpods pro gen 2       |      No      |
> These are all the bluetooth devices I have, sorry...

## Things to keep in mind
- The program will automatically detect your computers desktop location (used for youtube downloader so all video/audio downloaded will be stored on your desktop directory instead of the current working directory that the file launched in)<br> For example: `C:\Users\[user]\Desktop\[DownloadsFolderName from settings.json]`

- All settings that you enable/disable/change will be stored in **settings.json**. If you delete that file, you will be reseting all your settings to default

- When opening your setting file from `Settings > Open settings.json` in the app, it will launch in your default text editor meaning if you setup **vs code** to open .json files, then it will launch in **vs code**
