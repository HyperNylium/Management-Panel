</h4>

## Usage/Setup

1. Make sure to have the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.9.0 is recommended

2. Download the [Management_Panel source code](https://github.com/HyperNylium/Management_Panel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from Github

3. Un-zip the `Management_Panel-main.zip` file wherever you want

4. Launch the `Updater.exe` file and go with the flow ;)


## New with this update
- Minor bugs and mistakes fixed<br><br>

- New command for `Jarvis`. Saying "Lock workstation" will lock your computer (just like clicking `windows + L` keys but now included with jarvis)<br><br>

- New error catching method on importing critical libraries<br><br>

- You can now run/execute the app in whatever directory you want.<br><br>

- Optimized `Management_Panel` and `MP_MINI` (some of you were saying that the program was launching in 3 seconds. Well, now it should launch anywere between 400ms - 1.5s)<br><br>

- Full re-design of `MP_MINI` (Some text was to small and sometimes hard to read. So, i made things a bit bigger and easier to navigate)<br><br>

- Added "help" command to `Jarvis` (Whenever you say "help", jarvis will show you all of his commands for 5 seconds then go back to take commands)<br><br>

- All updates coming from `Updater.exe` will download much more faster now (instead of 300-500KB/s it will be more like 20-35MB/s)<br><br>

- Added user error detection to `Updater.exe`. When you enter the Incorrect answer in the input, It will return with an error

- The `Updater.exe` now launches it self in [administrator mode](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/run-as-admin-windows-11/#ftoc-heading-5) so it can install the Libraries on your systems [PATH](https://www.maketecheasier.com/what-is-the-windows-path#incontent-ad1)<br><br>

- Updated the "Jarvis play music" function. Should now scan for .mp3 (more format support coming soon) files in your music dir (C:\Users\[user]\Music) and list them one by one.<br><br>
  For example:<br>
    [1] Musicfile1.mp3<br>
    [2] Musicfile2.mp3<br>
    [3] Musicfile3.mp3<br><br>
    All you need to do is type the number infront of the file name in the given input and wait for your song to launch. If `Jarvis` has any problems, he will let you know and return to taking commands shortly after that.<br><br>


## Upcoming updates
- `Updater.exe` will overwrite all files while updating instead of downloading a `.zip` file


## Things to keep in mind
- The program will automatically detect your computers desktop location (used for `YT_Downloader.py`)<br> For example: `C:\Users\[user]\Desktop)`



- Please keep in mind that the `Updater.exe` is only for installing the required libraries and small updates. The updater gets updates to lol. So, i added a "Creators notes" section in the updater. If there is a update to the `Updater.exe` it self, no matter what it will tell you.

- The `Updater.exe` file requests [administrator](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/run-as-admin-windows-11/#ftoc-heading-5) privileges to run. If you click "No" when prompted, the updater will terminate itself and not run. The reason for that is, if you are going to download/install the required python libraries they need to be installed onto your computers PATH. Or else the program will have errors such as, crashing, not even launching, not able to find required files and more.<br><br>
