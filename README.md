<h3>
Version: v3.5.1<br>
Last updated Github Repo: 11/6/2022<br>
Description:<br>Computer control panel that has J.A.R.V.I.S, a Youtube video\audio downloader and talking updater (Alexia)
</h3>

## Usage/Setup

1. Make sure to have the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.7.0+ is compatible

2. Download the [Management_Panel source code](https://github.com/HyperNylium/Management_Panel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from Github

3. Un-zip the `Management_Panel-main.zip` file wherever you want

4. Launch the `Updater.exe` file and go with the flow ;)

## Things to keep in mind
- The program will automatically detect your home directorys desktop location. For example:<br>`C:\Users\[user]\Desktop)`

- You can now run/execute the app in whatever directory you want.

- Please keep in mind that the `Updater.exe` is only for installing the required libraries and small updates. The updater gets updates to lol. So, i added a "Creators notes" section in the updater. If there is a update to the `Updater.exe` it self, no matter what it will tell you. 

- The `Updater.exe` file requests [administrator](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/run-as-admin-windows-11/#ftoc-heading-5) privileges to run. If you click "No" when prompted, the updater will terminate itself and not run. The reason for that is, if you are going to download/install the required python libraries they need to be installed onto your computers PATH. Or else the program will have errors such as, crashing, not even launching, not able to find required files and more.

- All of the apps (Management_Panel.py, Updater.exe, etc) will look for updates automatically. If your version is greater then the live/public version (which for now is 3.5.0), You'll be prompted that that verion isn't an authentic version and the app boot time will be delayed by 10 seconds so you can read the prompt. It will also show you the current verion on your PC and the current live/public version. If you do not touch the variable at the very top of the program called `CurrentAppVersion` you will not see this prompt at all. And if you do see it for some reason, download the project again from this Github page and it should go away (but once again, if you don't touch the `CurrentAppVersion` variable, you wont see this in the first place)
